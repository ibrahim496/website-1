    <h1>REPORT</h1>
    <p>learning the basics of web development wasnt much of a challenge for me as i have had some expierence of making websites,the most challenge part for me was choosing a design as because of how i tend to not always be comfortable with the design i choose. the debugging process is particularly frustrating because when debugging  you can spend a whole lot of time trying to find the problem  when the problem might be just a closing tag you miss </p>
    <p>my module expierence has been good as the leacturer is a really good teacher and the classes are interactive and i really enjoy them </p>
    <p>the design decision i choose was infulenced from peoples portfolio i found online which the refrence to them will be found below and some from the web development module for example the home page i made was infulenced from the module topic 5 which in the powerpoint we were given a link to examples of animation and i had an idea when i saw one and thought i could add it to my page which i did and it came out good </p>
    <p>choosing the design was the hardest part for me as thats where i lacked but after seeing some examples and templates overtime i came up with my type of design. overall the assignment has help me developed and learn new skills and techniques in websites development which will help me in furthering my web development  skill  </p>
    <p>below they will be refrences of website that i used and validation report of the css and html</p>
